<h1>Krunker Central Cracked</h1>
<h3>Removed the authentication, version check and ads from Krunker Central</h3>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<ul>
  <li>To run this script, you need to install Tampermonkey</li>
  <li>Install Tampermonkey <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a></li>
  <li>Click on the Tampermonkey extensions icon once installed and press "Dashboard"</li>
  <li>Click the + icon to the left of "Installed Userscripts"</li>
  <li>Paste the code from <a href="https://github.com/Aureliustics/KrunkerCentral-Cracked/blob/main/KrunkerCentralCracked.js" target="_blank">KrunkerCentralCracked.js</a> into Tampermonkey and save (Control + S)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Navigate to https://codehs.com/sandbox</li>
  <li>Create, rename, delete, or copy link for sandboxes you save.</li>
  <li>When doing an assignment, you should see a new button next to the CodeHS logo on the top left.</li>
  <li>It is called "Cheat Menu". Clicking on it will show you the features.</li>
  <li>When are you in a sandbox, it will display the amount of time you have spent inside of it in real time. This does save and sync across tabs.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Known Bugs</h1>
<ul>
  <li>If either the Cheat menu or saved links UI is not showing up, refresh the page. This usually happens because Tampermonkey doesn't reinject upon subdomain changes.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<b>I am not responsible if you get caught using the cheat aswell as any damages that may occur during usage. If new versions of Krunker Central come out, I may come back and update the crack.</b>
